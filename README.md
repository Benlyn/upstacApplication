# upstacApplication

There are two folders
1.  UPSTAC-Week3-assignment - backend code
2. upstac-ui - Front end code


 -  The frontend code runs by typing ‘yarn start’ command in command prompt by navigating to the UI folder.
 -  The backend code runs simply by running the ‘UpstacApplication.java’ file.
 -  The user can view the registration page as well as the login page.
 -  Since default users and dummy data have been removed from the application, users would need to register a new account to log in.
 -  Upon login, the user can login as a patient and request for new test, which we implemented in this module.
 -  The login for tester and doctor profiles will work, but the functionalities involved with those users will not work since they are yet to be implemented.
